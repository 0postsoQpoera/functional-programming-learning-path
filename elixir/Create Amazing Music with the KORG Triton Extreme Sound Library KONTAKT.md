The KORG Triton Extreme workstation/sampler was one of the most popular and innovative products from Korg, which has been producing high-quality musical instruments and software since 1963. The Triton Extreme combined the best features of the previous Triton models, such as the touch-screen interface, the 16-track sequencer and the sampler function, with new enhancements, such as the 160 MB of wave ROM, the valve force circuit and the USB port.
 
The wave ROM of the Triton Extreme contained a rich and diverse collection of samples, which were recorded at 48 kHz for optimal sound quality. The samples included acoustic and electric guitars with natural vibrato, organs with rotary speaker effects, realistic choirs and a stunning concert grand piano. The library also incorporated the entire sample sets from some of the most popular expansion boards for the Triton series, such as the Trance Attack, the Orchestral Collection and the Vintage Archives. Additionally, the library featured some of the best sounds from other expansion boards and collections, such as the Dance Extreme, the Studio Essentials and the Pianos/Classic Keyboards.
 
The Triton Extreme also offered a powerful synthesis engine, which allowed users to create and edit their own sounds using various parameters and filters. The synthesis engine featured two LFOs with 21 waveforms each, multiple envelope generators, a modulation matrix with 42 sources and 51 destinations, and a comprehensive effects section with 5 insert effects, 2 master effects and a master EQ. The workstation/sampler also had dual polyphonic arpeggiators with 489 patterns, which could be synchronized to the internal or external clock.
