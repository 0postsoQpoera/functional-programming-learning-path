Unfortunately, Inazuma Eleven 3 The Ogre never got an official English release, unlike its counterparts Inazuma Eleven 3 Spark and Inazuma Eleven 3 Bomber, which were later ported to the Nintendo 3DS and localized for Europe in 2014. However, thanks to a dedicated team of fans, there is a way to enjoy this game in English, French or Japanese with original voices.
 
La Patch V0.6 is a fan-made translation project that started in 2011 by Roxas75, who wanted to translate the story of the game. However, he stopped his work after releasing a Christmas patch that only covered the first chapter. Later, another team led by OuiOui2003 took over the project and decided to focus on translating everything else in the game except the story, such as menus, items, moves, names, tutorials and graphics.
 
La Patch V0.6 was released in 2013 and it is the final version of the project. It offers three different patchs: European English, Undub and French. These patchs can only be applied to the Japanese version of Inazuma Eleven 3 The Ogre and they are not perfect. The game is very large and complex to translate, so there may be some errors, glitches or limitations. However, they provide a very playable and enjoyable experience for fans who want to try this game.
