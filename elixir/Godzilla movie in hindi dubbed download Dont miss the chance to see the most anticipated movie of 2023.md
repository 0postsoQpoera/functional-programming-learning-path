If you are wondering which Godzilla movies to watch first, you might want to start with the original Godzilla (1954), which introduced the iconic monster as a metaphor for the horrors of nuclear war. This movie is widely regarded as a masterpiece of Japanese cinema and a landmark of science fiction. You can also watch the Americanized version, Godzilla, King of the Monsters! (1956), which added scenes with Raymond Burr as a reporter witnessing the destruction.
 
Another movie that you should not miss is Mothra vs. Godzilla (1964), which featured the first appearance of Mothra, one of Godzilla's most popular allies and enemies.

This movie is full of humor, action, and spectacle, and has two different endings depending on which version you watch. You might also like Godzilla vs. Megalon (1973), which featured Godzilla's sidekick Jet Jaguar, a robot that can grow to giant size and communicate with monsters. This movie is so cheesy and absurd that it became a cult classic.
 
If you are interested in some modern and realistic movies, you might want to check out Shin Godzilla (2016), which rebooted the franchise with a darker and more political tone. This movie portrayed Godzilla as a terrifying force of nature that evolves rapidly and challenges humanity's response.
